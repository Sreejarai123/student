## About Me
Hi my name is Sreeja and I am a current junior at Del Norte High School
- I like going to concerts this past year I went to the Harry styles, The Weeknd, SZA, and Olivia rodrigo. I like going to the beach and hanging out with my friends. My favorite animal is a dog and I really want a mini golden doodle. I like playing tennis and am on the varsity team as well as the track team and I do dance outside of school. 
- Homework requirments: I have about 2 hours of homework every day about 30 minutes from each class sometimes the homework is collaborative but mainly it is meant to be done solo.
