## About Me
Hi my name is Sreeja and I am a current junior at Del Norte High School
- I like going to concerts this past year I went to the Harry styles, The Weeknd, SZA, and Olivia rodrigo. I like going to the beach and hanging out with my friends I like playing tennis and am on the varsity team as well as the track team.
- Homework requirments: I have about 2 hours of homework every day about 30 minutes from each class sometimes the homework is collaborative but mainly it is meant to be done solo.  

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
